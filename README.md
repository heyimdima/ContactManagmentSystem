# ContactManagmentSystem

## Overview
This was the project I did for my CST-210 class, and the goal was to do the following:

'''Implement a software solution creates a contact management system. The contact management system will
use file input/output to store user-inputted names, addresses, and phone numbers.  The user can choose to input  
new contact or search for a contact using a unique identifier. When the program is terminated, the contacts are  
saved in a .txt file so they are available the next time the program is run.'''


## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to:
  *Use multiple levels of abstraction in software design
