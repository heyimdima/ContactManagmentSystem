# ContactManagmentSystem

## Overview
This was the project I did for my CST-210 class, and the objective was to do the following:

* Implement a software solution that creates a contact management system. 
* The contact management system will use file input/output to store user-inputted names, addresses, and phone numbers.  
* The user can choose to input new contact or search for a contact using a unique identifier. 
* When the program is terminated, the contacts are saved in a .txt file so they are available the next time the program is run.


## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to:
* Use multiple levels of abstraction in software design.
* Utilize file input/output in a C++ program.
* Utilize operator overloading in a C++ program.
